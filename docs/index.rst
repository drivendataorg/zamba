*Zamba means "forest" in the Lingala language.*

Zamba is a command-line tool built in Python to automatically identify the
species seen in camera trap videos from sites in central Africa. Using the
combined input of various deep learning models, the tool makes predictions
for 23 common species in these videos (as well as blank, or, "no species
present").

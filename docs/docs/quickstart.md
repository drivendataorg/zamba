# Quickstart

This section assumes you have successfully installed `zamba` and want to get
right to either making species predictions for some videos, or training a model! 

All of the commands on this page should be run at the command line. On
macOS, this can be done in the terminal (âŒ˜+space, "Terminal"). On Windows, this can be done in a command prompt, or if you installed Anaconda an anaconda prompt (Start > Anaconda3 > Anaconda Prompt).

## How do I input my videos to `zamba`?

You can input the path to a directory of videos to classify. 

* **The folder must contain only valid video files**, since `zamba` will try to load all of the files in the directory. 
* `zamba` supports the same video formats as FFMPEG, [which are listed here](https://www.ffmpeg.org/general.html#Supported-File-Formats_002c-Codecs-or-Features).
* `zamba` will only generate predictions for the videos in the top level of a directory (`zamba` does not currently extract videos from nested directories).

For example, say we have a directory of videos called `example_vids` that we want to generate predictions for using `zamba`. Let's list the videos:

```console
$ ls example_vids/
blank.mp4
chimp.mp4
eleph.mp4
leopard.mp4
```

Here are some screenshots from those videos:
<table class="table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:center">blank.mp4<br/>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/drivendata-public-assets/zamba-2-blank-sm.jpg" alt="Blank frame seen from a camera trap" style="width:400px;"/>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:center">chimp.mp4<br/>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/drivendata-public-assets/zamba-2-chimp-sm.jpg" alt="Leopard seen from a camera trap" style="width:400px;"/>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:center">eleph.mp4<br/>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/drivendata-public-assets/zamba-2-eleph-sm.jpg" alt="Elephant seen from a camera trap" style="width:400px">
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:center">leopard.mp4<br/>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/drivendata-public-assets/zamba-2-leopard-sm.jpg" alt="cat" style="width:400px;"/>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

In this example, the videos have meaningful names so that we can easily
compare the predictions made by `zamba`. In practice, your videos will
probably be named something much less useful!

## Generating predictions

To generate and save predictions for your videos using the default settings, run:

```console
$ zamba predict --data-dir example_vids/
```

`zamba` will output a `.csv` file with rows labeled by each video filename and columns for each class (ie. species). The default prediction will store all class probabilities, so that cell (i,j) is *the probability that animal j is present in video i.* 
Predictions will be saved to `{model name}_{current timestamp}_preds.csv`.
For example, running `zamba predict` on 9/15/2021 with the `time_distributed` model (the default) will save out predictions to `time_distributed_2021-09-15_preds.csv`. 

Adding the argument `--output-class-names` will simplify the predictions to return only the *most likely* animal in each video:

```console
$ zamba predict --data-dir example_vids/ --output-class-names
$ cat time_distributed_2021-09-15_preds.csv
vids/blank.mp4,blank
vids/chimp.mp4,chimpanzee_bonobo
vids/eleph.mp4,elephant
vids/leopard.mp4,leopard
```

## Training a model

Say that we have labels for the videos in the `example_vids` folder saved in `example_labels.csv`. To train a model, run:

```console
$ zamba train --data-dir example_vids/ --labels example_labels.csv
```

The labels file must have columns for both filepath and label. Let's print the example labels:

```console
$ cat example_labels.csv
filepath,label
example_vids/eleph.MP4,elephant
example_vids/leopard.MP4,leopard
example_vids/blank.MP4,blank
example_vids/chimp.MP4,chimpanzee_bonobo
```

<!-- TODO: where will the model be saved?><!-->

## Downloading model weights

**`zamba` needs to download the "weights" files for the neural networks that it uses to make predictions. On first run it will download ~200-500 MB of files with these weights depending which model you choose.** 
Once a model's weights are downloaded, the tool will use the local version and will not need to perform this download again. If you are not in the US, we recommend running the above command with the additional flag either `--weight_download_region eu` or `--weight_download_region asia` depending on your location. The closer you are to the server the faster the downloads will be.

## Getting help

Once zamba is installed, you can see more details of each function with `--help`. 

To get help with `zamba predict`:

```console
$ zamba predict --help

Usage: zamba predict [OPTIONS]

  Identify species in a video.

  This is a command line interface for prediction on camera trap footage.
  Given a path to camera trap footage, the predict function use a deep
  learning model to predict the presence or absense of a variety of species
  of common interest to wildlife researchers working with camera trap data.

  If an argument is specified in both the command line and in a yaml file,
  the command line input will take precedence.

  --data-dir PATH                 Path to folder containing videos.
  --filepaths PATH                Path to csv containing `filepath` column

  --proba-threshold FLOAT         Probability threshold for classification
                                  between 0 and 1. If specified binary
                                  predictions are returned with 1 being
                                  greater than the threshold, 0 being less
                                  than or equal to. If not specified,
                                  probabilities between 0 and 1 are returned.

  --output-class-names / --no-output-class-names

                                  of the most likely class. If False, we
                                  return a probability or indicator (depending
                                  on --proba_threshold) for every possible

                                  Skip check that verifies all videos can be
                                  loaded prior to inference. Only use if

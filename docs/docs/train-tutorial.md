# User Tutorial: Training a Model on Labaled Videos

This section walks through how to train a model using `zamba`. If you are new to `zamba` and just want to classify some videos as soon as possible, see the [Quickstart](quickstart.md) guide.

This tutorial goes over the steps for using `zamba` if:

* You already have `zamba` installed (for details see the [Installation](install.md) page)
* You have labeled videos that you want to use to train or finetune a model

`zamba` can run two types of model training:

* Fine-tuning a model with labels that are a subset of the possible [zamba labels](models.md#species-classes)
* Fine-tuning a model to predict an entirely new set of labels

The process is the same for both cases.

## Basic usage: command line interface

Say that we want to finetune the `time_distributed` model based on the videos in `example_vids` and the labels in `example_labels.csv`. 

Minimum example for training in the command line:

```console
$ zamba train --data-dir example_vids/ --labels example_labels.csv
```

### Required arguments

To run `zamba train` in the command line, you must specify both `--data-directory` and `--labels`.

* **`--data-dir PATH`:** Path to the folder containing your labeled videos.
* **`--labels PATH`:** Path to a CSV containing the video labels to use as ground truth during training. There must be columns for both filepath and label. Optionally, there can also be columns for `split` (`train`, `val`, or `holdout`) and `site`. If your labels file does not have a column for `split`, you can alternately use the `split_proportions` argument.


## Basic usage: Python package

Say that we want to finetune the `time_distributed` model based on the videos in `example_vids` and the labels in `example_labels.csv`. 

Minimum example for training using the Python package:

```python
from zamba.models.model_manager import train_model
from zamba.models.config import TrainConfig
from zamba.data.video import VideoLoaderConfig

train_config = TrainConfig(data_directory="example_vids/", labels="example_labels.csv")
video_loader_config = VideoLoaderConfig(
    video_height=224, video_width=224, total_frames=16
)

train_model(train_config=train_config, video_loader_config=video_loader_config)

```

To specify various parameters when running `train_model`, the first step is to instantiate [`TrainConfig`](configurations.md#training-arguments) and [`VideoLoaderConfig`](configurations.md#video-loading-arguments) with any specifications for model training and video loading respectively. The only two arguments that can be specified in `train_model` are `train_config` and `video_loader_config`.

### Required arguments

To run `train_model` in Python, you must specify both `data_directory` and `labels` when `TrainConfig` is instantiated.

* **`data_directory (DirectoryPath)`:** Path to the folder containing your videos.

* **`labels (FilePath or pd.DataFrame)`:** Either the path to a CSV file with labels for training, or a dataframe of the training labels. There must be columns for `filename` and `label`.

In the command line, video loading configurations are loaded by default based on the model being used. This is not the case in Python. There are additional requirements for `VideoLoaderConfig` based on the model you are using.

* **`video_height (int)`, `video_width (int)`:** Dimensions for resizing videos as they are loaded. 
    - `time_distributed` or `european`: The suggested dimensions are 224x224, but any integers are acceptable
    - `slowfast`: Both must be greater than or equal to 200
* **`total_frames (int)`:** The number of frames to select from each video and use during training. 
    * `time_distributed` or `european`: Must be 16
    * `slowfast`: Must be 32

The full recommended `VideoLoaderConfig` for the `time_distributed` or `european` model is:
```python
from zamba.data.video import VideoLoaderConfig
from zamba.models.megadetector_lite_yolox import MegadetectorLiteYoloXConfig

megadetector_config = MegadetectorLiteYoloXConfig(
    confidence=0.25, fill_mode="score_sorted", n_frames=16
)
video_loader_config = VideoLoaderConfig(
    video_height=224,
    video_width=224,
    crop_bottom_pixels=50,
    ensure_total_frames=True,
    megadetector_list_config=megadetector_config,
    total_frames=16,
)
```

You can see the full default configuration for each model in `models/config`<!-- TODO: add link to source and update if needed><!-->. For detailed explanations of all possible configuration arguments, see [All Optional Arguments](configurations.md).

## Default behavior

By default, the model will be saved to a folder in the current working directory called `zamba_{model_name}`. For example, a model finetuned from the provided `time_distributed` model (the default) will be saved in `zamba_time_distributed`. 

```console
$ zamba train --data-dir example_vids/ --labels example_labels.csv
$ ls zamba_time_distributed
configuration.yaml 
hparams.yaml
time_distributed.ckpt
events.out.tfevents.1632250686.ip-172-31-15-179.14229.0
test_metrics.json
val_metrics.json
```

`zamba_time_distributed` contains three files:

* `configuration.yaml`: The full model configuration used to generate the given model, including `video_loader_config` and `train_config`. To continue training using the same configuration, or to train another model using the same configuration, you can pass in `configurations.yaml` (see [Specifying Model Configurations with a YAML File](yaml-config.md)).
* `hparams.yaml`: Model hyperparameters. For example, the YAML file below tells us that the model was trained with a learning rate (`lr`) of 0.001:
    ```yaml
    $ cat zamba_time_distributed/hparams.yaml

    lr: 0.001
    model_class: TimeDistributedEfficientNetMultiLayerHead
    num_frames: 16
    scheduler: MultiStepLR
    scheduler_params:
    gamma: 0.5
    milestones:
    - 3
    verbose: true
    species:
    - species_blank
    - species_chimpanzee_bonobo
    - species_elephant
    - species_leopard
    ```
* `time_distributed.ckpt`: Model checkpoint. The model checkpoint also includes both the model configuration in `configuration.yaml` and the model hyperparameters in `hparams.yaml`. You can continue training from this checkpoint by passing it to `zamba train` with the `--checkpoint` flag:
    ```console
    $ zamba train --checkpoint time_distributed.ckpt --data-dir example_vids/ --labels example_labels.csv
    ```
* `events.out.tfevents.1632250686.ip-172-31-15-179.14229.0`: [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/get_started) logs
* `test_metrics.json`: The model's performance on the test subset
* `val_metrics.json`: The model's performance on the validation subset

## Step-by-step tutorial

### 1. Specify the path to your videos 

Save all of your videos in one folder.

* Your videos should all be saved in formats that are suppored by FFmpeg, [which are listed here](https://www.ffmpeg.org/general.html#Supported-File-Formats_002c-Codecs-or-Features).
* Your video folder must contain only valid video files, since zamba will try to load all of the files in the directory.
* Your videos must all be in the top level of the video folder - `zamba` does not extract videos from nested directories.

Add the path to your video folder with `--data-dir`. For example, if your videos are in a folder called `example_vids`, add `--data-dir example_vids/` to your command.

=== "CLI"
    ```console
    $ zamba train --data-dir example_vids
    ```

=== "Python"
    ```python
    from zamba.models.config import TrainConfig

    train_config = TrainConfig(data_directory='example_vids/')
    ```
Note that the above will not run yet because labels are not specified.

### 2. Specify your labels

Your labels should be saved in a `.csv` file with columns for filepath and label. For example:

```console
$ cat example_labels.csv
filepath,label
example_vids/eleph.MP4,elephant
example_vids/leopard.MP4,leopard
example_vids/blank.MP4,blank
example_vids/chimp.MP4,chimpanzee_bonobo
```

Add the path to your labels with `--labels`.  For example, if your videos are in a folder called `example_vids` and your labels are saved in `example_labels.csv`:

=== "CLI"
    ```console
    $ zamba train --data-dir example_vids/ --labels example_labels.csv
    ```
=== "Python"
    In Python, the labels are passed in when `TrainConfig` is instantiated. The Python package allows you to pass in labels as either a file path or a pandas dataframe:
    ```python
    labels_dataframe = pd.read_csv('example_labels.csv', index_col='filepath')
    train_config = TrainConfig(data_directory='example_vids/', labels=labels_dataframe)
    ```

#### Labels `zamba` has seen before

Your labels may be included in the list of [`zamba` class labels](models.md#species-classes) that the provided models are trained to predict. If so, the relevant model that ships with `zamba` will essentially be used as a checkpoint, and model training will resume from that checkpoint.

#### Completely new labels

You can also train a model to predict completely new labels - the world is your oyster! (We'd love to see a model trained to predict oysters.) If this is the case, the model architecture will replace the final [neural network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&t=995s) layer with a new head that predicts *your* labels instead of those that ship with `zamba`. [Backpropogation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U) will continue from that point with the new head. This process is called [transfer learning](https://keras.io/guides/transfer_learning/).

### 3. Choose a model for training

If your videos contain species common to central or west Africa, use the [`time_distributed` model](models.md#time-distributed). If they contain species common to western Europe, use the [`european` model](models.md#european). We do not recommend using the [`slowfast` model](models.md#slowfast) for training because it is much more computationally intensive and slower to run.

Add the model name to your command with `--model`. The `time_distributed` model will be used if no model is specified. For example, if you want to continue training the `european` model based on the videos in `example_euro_vids` and the labels in `example_euro_labels.csv`:

=== "CLI"
    ```console
    $ zamba train --data-dir example_euro_vids/ --labels example_euro_labels.csv --model european
    ```
=== "Python"
    ```python
    train_config = TrainConfig(
        data_directory="example_euro_vids/",
        labels="example_euro_labels.csv",
        model_name="european",
    )
    ```

### 4. Specify any additional parameters

And there's so much more! You can also do things like specify your region for faster model download (`--weight-download-region`), start training from a saved model checkpoint (`--checkpoint`), or specify a different path where your model should be saved (`--save-directory`). To read about a few common considerations, see the [Guide to Common Optional Parameters](extra-options.md) page.

### 5. Test your configuration with a dry run

Before kicking off the full model training, we recommend testing your code with a "dry run". This will run one training and validation batch for one epoch to quickly detect any bugs. See the [Debugging](debugging.md) page for details.

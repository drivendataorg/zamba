*Zamba means "forest" in the Lingala language.*


Zamba is a tool built in Python to automatically identify the species seen
in camera trap videos from sites in Africa and Europe. Using the combined
input of various deep learning models, the tool makes predictions for 42
common species in these videos (as well as blank, or, "no species present").
Zamba can be accessed as both a command-line tool and a Python package.

Zamba ships with three model options. `time_distributed` and `slowfast` are
trained on 32 common species from central and west Africa. `european` is trained
on 11 common species from western Europe. `time_distributed` and `european` are image-based models while `slowfast` is a video-based model.

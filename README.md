*Zamba means "forest" in the Lingala language.*

Zamba is a tool built in Python to automatically identify the species seen
in camera trap videos from sites in Africa and Europe. Using the combined
input of various deep learning models, the tool makes predictions for 42
common species in these videos (as well as blank, or, "no species present").
Zamba can be used both as a command-line tool and as a Python package.
